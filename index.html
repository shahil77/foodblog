                <h3>Best Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
                <p>There are over 10 chocolate chip cookie recipes on I am a Food Blog (some of them are slight variations, but all with chocolate chip cookie bases) and I think it’s safe to say that I have tested, made, and eaten a LOT of chocolate chip cookies in my life. I’m even on a never ending quest to find the best store bought chocolate chip cookie in the world.

                <h3>Honey Baked Ham</h3>
                <p>If you’ve never glazed your own ham before or if you’ve only ever eaten dry ham, you’re probably wondering why I think ham is so delicious. Trust me when I say a perfectly glazed ham is just the right amount of salty balanced with sweet, with full hammy flavor.

                    Ham is everything right in the world, at least at the dinner table. Thanksgiving this year is looking a little different so maybe you’re not making a whole turkey, but who’s to say you can’t make yourself a ham?! Ham comes in all shapes and sizes making it perfect for a little pandemic honey baked ham holiday cheer.</p>

                <p>Thanksgiving is all about the sides, am I right? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I LOVE turkey, but I could make a straight up meal of sides. Give me all the carbs, please and thank you. Every family has their idea of what Thanksgiving is, but with this year looking a little different, maybe it’s time to switch it up? If you’re looking for some Thanksgiving side dish inspiration, you’re in the right place.</p>

                <h3>Japanese Pancakes</h3>
                <p>Ever since the first time I laid eyes on those giggly giant fluffy Japanese pancakes, I’ve been obsessed. We may or may not have been to almost every fluffy pancake place in Tokyo because of my obsession – here’s a run down on the places we’ve been to. I love the way Japanese pancakes taste: light, airy, and oh so delicious.


                    The best part of going to the pancake places, aside from eating the pancakes, is that you get to watch them expertly shape, flip, and plate up serving after serving of fluffy goodness. It’s nice to watch but also kind of awkward because I’m sure the pancake peeps don’t really want anyone staring at them. I would have major anxiety if people were watching me do my job day after day after day.

                <h3>Avocado Bread: like banana bread, but with avocados</h3>
                <p>To this day, I’m still searching for that elusive bread. In some ways whenever I have banana bread I feel betrayed. I’m always hoping for a taste of the past, only to be disappointed by overly sweet, dry loaves.

                    In desperation, I turned to the avocado. I don’t have a cool story for why I decided on avocados, aside from the fact that I thought it would be hilarious to have avocado toast made with avocado bread (the yeasted kind). From there I started thinking about quick breads and why bananas, zucchinis, and carrots got all the love.</p>

                <h3>Waffled Donut Recipe</h3>
                <p>I loved the contrast between the crust, creamy insides and fluffy un-waffled spots. It’s pure genius! Of course, it’s not my genius – I’ll be the first to say that waffled donuts are not a new invention. People have waffled pizza, falafel and of course, donuts. However, I did discover, after a little research, that most people make waffled donuts in 1 of 2 ways: cake donut batter “baked” in a waffle machine or waffles cut out and deep-fried like a donut.

                    This is definitely the simpler route and may be a fraud of a recipe, but one bite and I think you’ll forgive me. How could you not!? WAFFLED DONUTS! Super-easy and super-delicious. It’s almost the weekend, time to get your donut on!</p>

               <p><span>Buy a ham:</span> Hams come fully cooked at the store making this the simplest meat dish you’ll ever prepare. Get a bone-in spiral cut ham, more on that below.
